This is a battle bot design that reminds me of when cars use trucks in movies as jumps.
The whole thing will be assemebled with m4 and m3 screws.
I am making this robot to hopefully compete in the rock and robots competion on the 11th of january 2026.
I will try to aim to print the whole thing out of cf nylon as I kno w a freind with a lot of it.

I had to insert a screenshot because otherwise you wouldnt be able to see the colours.
